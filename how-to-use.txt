Open your project configuration: double-click the project name in the left tree view. 
Select your app from the TARGETS section, then select the Info tab, and expand the URL Types section.
Click the + button, and add a URL scheme for your reversed client ID. 
To find this value, open the GoogleService-Info.plist configuration file, and look for the REVERSED_CLIENT_ID key. 
Copy the value of that key, and paste it into the URL Schemes box on the configuration page. 
Leave the other fields blank.
